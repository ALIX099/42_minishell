### ðŸ”¹ Overview
**42 MiniShell** is a Unix-like shell built from scratch in C.  
It supports command parsing, redirections, pipes, and built-in commands while handling signals and memory safely.  
The project demonstrates **low-level system programming**, **process control**, and **inter-process communication (IPC)**.  

---

### ðŸ›  Features
- âœ… Command execution with arguments  
- âœ… Built-in commands: `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`  
- âœ… Input/output redirections: `>`, `>>`, `<`  
- âœ… Pipes: `|` for chaining commands  
- âœ… Signal handling: `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`  
- âœ… Memory-safe execution (no leaks with proper cleanup)

### âš¡ Technical Highlights
- Parsing and tokenization of user input  
- Environment variable management  
- Use of **fork()**, **execve()**, **waitpid()**, and **dup2()**  
- Error handling for invalid commands or redirections  
- Modular code for readability and maintainability
